# dangerzone-converter

This is the container for [dangerzone](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/dangerzone), which converts potentially a dangerous PDF, office document, or image into a safe PDF.

## Development notes

Issues are tracked [here](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/dangerzone/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acontainer), in the dangerzone repository using the `container` label.

Containers are built in continuous integration when commits are pushed to the `stable` branch.
